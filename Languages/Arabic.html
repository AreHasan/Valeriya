        <h2>Arabic</h2>
        <p>This is a language that I developed an interest for when I began studying in university. 
            <br> <br>
            The reason I developed interest for it, is because I knew it was vastly different from any other language I had previous knowledge in. Additionally, it is one of the most widely spoken languages out there, and I figured it would be a useful language to add to my language plate (language plate referring to the languages I would be able to speak fluently). 
            <br> <br>
            This is why, upon finding the opportunity to study Arabic at a language workshop at my university, I begin to do so. I started by attending the language group meetings, where we began with the alphabet, and then moved onto greetings, useful words and terminology. 
            <br> <br>
            I was very fixated on the alphabet, and recall barely taking any notes after that, because I was so focussed on trying to memorize each letter, and how it changed dependant of its position in a word in Arabic script. To be frank, I am still stuck on this part, because of lack of time I can allocate towards it, and the fact that I’m currently prioritizing Turkish as my primary language goal.
            <br> <br>
            I hope to soon be able to master the alphabet, and script, so I can move onto the grammar and vocabulary of the language.
            <br> <br>
            I also attempted to learn a little bit about the phonetics behind it, but was not able to find many resources. 
            <br> <br>
            Another obstacle I came across was the lack of ability to decide which dialect I wanted to focus on. Currently, I’m debating between the Lebanese and the Egyptian dialect. Still in a pickle with this one. 
            <br> <br>
            I would hope to progress a little more going into the next school year, and make Arabic my next language goal after Turkish.

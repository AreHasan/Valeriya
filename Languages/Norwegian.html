        <h2>Norwegian</h2>
        <p>Norwegian was a language I very briefly studied when I started high school in grade 9. The reason why? I started a new TV series called “Skam”. 
            <br> <br>
            I was very influenced by this TV show, because I thought it was so cool and interesting, thus I picked up on a few Norwegian words, and decided to start studying Norwegian via Duolingo. It did not last very long, it was a brief month of studying, so I remember virtually nothing from what I learned.  
            <br> <br>
            I recall my biggest difficulty encountering the language was the pronunciation. I just remember it being so hard for me to master, and because pronunciation is the key component for me in a language, I quickly lost motivation and discontinued studying the language. 
            <br> <br>
            I don’t think this is a language I will return to in the future, but I do intend to study a language from the Germanic family.. So if I don’t pick German, I just might go back and choose Norwegian for that!

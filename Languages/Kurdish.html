        <h2>Kurdish</h2>
        <p>This is a language I had never heard of, prior to meeting a lovely group of boys last year, with whom I hang out with to this day. The only reason I have base level understanding of “useful words” (and lots of curses) in the language, is because they taught me them. 
            <br> <br>
            I don’t think this is a language I am going to take seriously at the moment, but I do enjoy listening to my guy friends converse with one another, because I can appreciate the beauty of the language, even though I don’t understand it. 
            <br> <br>
            I will continue to pick up on words, and build up my lexicon for that matter, because this is one of the ways that I show appreciation and that I care for my friends, by taking interest in their culture and native language. It helps me to better understand them as people, and that is why I will continue to learn a little more each day..

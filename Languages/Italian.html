        <h2>Italian</h2>
        <p>Italian is a language I have found to be beautiful from a very young age. From my childhood obsession tv-series, “Winx Club”, to my teenage series binges with “Baby” and “Skam Italia”, I have found myself drawn towards Italian cinematography for a while now!  
            <br> <br>
            Watching these TV shows allowed me to immerse myself into the prosody of the language, thus I was able to mimic the pronunciation at an adequate level, without understanding much of what I was saying. I also of course, picked up on a few words and expressions, and felt more compelled to study the language.
            <br> <br>
            I had no idea where to start, until I reached my gap semester after graduating high school a semester early. I found the opportunity to study it online via another school in the Vancouver area. This is where I began to study the language. 
            <br> <br>
            I allocated a lot of time towards studying the phonetics of the language, because pronunciation is one of the key focusses in language learning for me. Personally, I like to sound as native-like as possible, and as a result, I spent a couple months primarily on finding as many resources as possible about Italian pronunciation rules and phonics.
            <br> <br>
            I knew phonetics wasn’t the only component in the language, so I started to study some grammar as well, but kept returning to phonetics ultimately. I think this is the reason why I got bored of the language, because the time I spent on pronunciation was making the language become tedious for me..
            <br> <br>
            I also tried, practicing with native speakers via the language-exchange platforms “HelloTalk” and “Tandem”.  I am still in touch with one person from there, but I don’t particularly speak to many Italians anymore. 
            <br> <br>
            As of the present moment, I do not intend to study the language any further, but I do admire it as a language itself; it is very harmonic and beautiful.

        <h2>Turkish</h2>
        <p>This is not a language I ever imagined I would study, but somehow I ended up here, with it being my primary language goal at the present moment. 
            <br> <br>
            I had heard about Turkey early on in my life, as it was a popular travel destination for a lot of people back home. However, my first exposure to the language and culture occurred when I found myself at the Istanbul airport in February 2022. 
            <br> <br>
            Strolling through the airport, my first time as a solo traveler, I saw Turkish words written on a poster on a wall. I don’t know what it is about written Turkish, but it just looks so special to me. I remember staring at the words, and trying to figure out what might be written, and having absolutely no clue. This is where my desire to deconstruct this mysterious language was born.
            <br> <br>
            I started right at the airport by finding a YouTube video during my 14 hour layover, and started learning the Turkish alphabet and Turkish greetings there and then. And after returning to Canada, I found myself too preoccupied with Italian, and set Turkish aside, though I still had the desire to study the language. 
            <br> <br>
            Around the end of summer, I began watching a Turkish TV series, “Sen çal kapımı” which further propelled my desire to study language. 
            <br> <br>
            When visiting a McGill University in Montreal in the fall, I spoke to the head of the Turkish language department, who explained some basic concepts to me in Turkish, recommended me a lovely textbook, and created a fire for learning Turkish from the spark that was born in Istanbul. 
            <br> <br>
            What is particularly interesting to me about the language, is the agglutination structure of the suffixes. The syntax is the absolute reverse of that in English. The fact that it makes little sense to me is exactly why I want to make sense of it.
            <br> <br>
            Upon finishing my first year of university, having tried various Turkish foods at Turkish cafes and restaurants around Vancouver, and finishing another Turkish TV series “Vatanım sensin”, I feel more motivated than ever to study the language. I’m currently at a very basic level, but I’m working on developing my grammar, and vocabulary at the present moment. I hope to add this language to my language plate.

        <h2>English</h2>
        <p>English is one of my two native languages. <br>
            <br>
            Around the age of three, I moved to Canada with my family. I began attending a Montessori school, where my education was provided in both English and Russian. Thanks to this, I was able to acquire both languages simultaneously. I know I rapidly progressed in my acquisition of English, because I remember English feeling like my first language. <br> 
            <br>
            As I grew older, I began regularly visiting the library with my sister and father. My father encouraged us to read, and this is where a new hobby of mine developed. I went big and hard on reading, and as a result, acquired greater and richer vocabulary with each day. <br>
            <br>
            And as any other personâ€™s first language acquisition journey throughout their life, with continued use of the language and finding myself in an English-speaking environment, I began to speak it natively. <br>
            <br>
            Despite my full integration into an English-speaking environment, English is my least favourite language, as I find it rather unpleasant to the ear, and mostly senseless grammatically. I tend to avoid to use it when possible. <br>
            <br>
            English is definitely my strongest language in terms of both comprehension and expression. It is the language I encounter the most throughout my day-to-day life. I am the most at ease with it, and can effectively communicate my needs and feelings with it. <br>

        <h2>Spanish</h2>
        <p>Spanish is a language I was never particularly interested in learning. I acknowledged the melodiousness of it, but I never quite saw the beauty in it. This is not a criticism towards the language, but simply a feeling I experienced and resonated with. 
            <br> <br>
            As I left high school and began studying in university, I began listening to a lot more Latin music. At this time I had realized I actually really enjoyed the flow of the speech in the language, and this was potentially a new language I could begin to study.
            <br> <br>
            As I committed myself to the language, acquired some textbooks and was all set to go, I sort of lost that desire.. The reason why? I was simply too busy to start, and the fleeting feelings had passed. I also realized I was very familiar with the construction of the language (because I speak French), and thus I suddenly began to feel like Spanish would be a whole lot of memorization, rather than the breaking down of new concepts. 
            <br> <br>
            Currently, I am on break with this language, and I do not want to particularly study it, nor prioritize it at this point in my life. However, I am certain my desire will be reborn at some point in the future, and because I have all the resources I need, I may acquire some base level in it later on in my life.

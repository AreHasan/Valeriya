        <h2>Ukrainian</h2>
        <p>Ukrainian is my maternal grandmother’s native language, and thus, when I was in grade 9, I thought it would be neat to learn a few words in Ukrainian to surprise her. 
            <br> <br>
            I never actually particularly had an interest to study the language apart from this reason, so, of course, I didn’t go very far with this. But I still recall a few of the words that I learned to this day. 
            <br> <br>
            Despite what many people will say, I personally find that Ukrainian and Russian are not very mutually intelligible. The lack of resemblance between the two languages decreases my desire to study it, because I simply see no use in doing so. It’s not similar enough for me to be able to pick up on it easily, but it’s also not different enough in structure for it to be appealing for me to deconstruct. I’m a big fan of selecting languages from different language families because I like to rack my brains -- thus similar constructions are largely unappealing to me. 
            <br> <br>
            I don’t have a particular interest in continuing to study the language, it was more of a fleeting interest years ago. Thus, I don’t believe this is a language I will ever return to, but I can appreciate its richness in vocabulary and proximity to other Slavic languages.

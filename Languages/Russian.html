        <h2>Russian</h2>
        <p class="russianp">Russian is my other native language, and it was the first language I was ever exposed to growing up. I am able to comprehend and express myself in it well, however, I do have minor setbacks, particularly when it comes to more narrow terminology, as this is not something I studied growing up in Canadian schools.
            <br> <br>
            Around the age of eight I was concerned with my ability to read in my native language, so I remember picking out a children’s book, and reading it over and over until I was able to read it with fluency. Fluency referring to the fluidity of my speech (no stutters or odd pauses). I then switched to another book, and repeated the same process until I got through all of my children’s books.
            <br> <br>
            Then, I recall asking my mother for help to learn Russian grammar, and how to write in Russian cursive.  She did so for a bit, however at a certain point she was unable to continue to help me. I did not let this stop me, and I took it upon myself to continue alone with workbooks from back home until roughly the age of 10.
            <br> <br>
            The following couple of years, I began researching ways I could improve my Russian. I came across a Russian Language School in Vancouver. The opportunity to attend the school was something I requested for my parents as my Christmas gift. My wish was granted, and I had begun attending the school shortly before turning 14. At the school, I rapidly acquired knowledge on Russian grammar, and progressed in my comprehension, and ability to express myself in the language. 
            <br> <br>
            Post graduating, I feel more deeply connected with my culture and native language. I am able to read, write, understand, and freely express myself in the language with little difficulty. I did not always feel this way growing up, and I am proud to have put so much time and work into gaining this  reconnection with my culture so early in my life.
            <br> <br>
            My culture and language are the roots of me. It is important to me to be in tune and connected with that part of my identity, and this is why I regularly make an effort to stay connected with the Russian-speaking community around me.

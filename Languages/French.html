        <h2>French</h2>
        <p>French is the only foreign language I can speak confidently.
            <br> <br>
            I was first exposed to it when I was six years old, and by that I mean I learned a few phrases and vocabulary words for fruits, vegetables, and such at the Montessori school I attended growing up.  Additionally, in grade four, it is mandatory to learn French in schools across Canada. That is the second time I was introduced to the language. 
            <br> <br>
            Honestly though, I didn’t really learn much in French until I reached high school in grade 9. I was given the choice to either continue studying French, or choose another foreign language to study. I decided to continue studying French because I figured since I had already studied it, it would be easier. In addition to that, I generally found the French language to be beautiful, and I started to develop the “Parisian dream” in mind.
            <br> <br>
            I was placed into my very first high school French class, where I happened to have a very strict teacher. It was extremely difficult for me to do well in the class, but I managed to do above my expectations. During the five months I spent in this teacher’s class, my French progressed from virtually no knowledge in the language, to me constructing rather complex sentences. I remember the bulk of my growth in French occurring during this time. I continued with French 10 and French 11, where I further developed my competencies. 
            <br> <br>
            Then, the pandemic hit. I was no longer able to take French classes with my “strict” French teacher. I resorted to maintaining my knowledge in the language via speaking to Francophones over an app called “HelloTalk”. There I had met some lovely people, and some not so great ones. Kind of a mixed batch. I am still in touch with a few of the people I met on there.
            <br> <br>
            I was actually quite picky with the people I chose to speak to on this platform, because I wanted to acquire the standard Parisian French accent. I did this because I wanted to avoid any influence of other French accents. As a result, I gained more or less native-like pronunciation in standard Parisian French, and integrated myself into the language in a way where I was no longer thinking in English, but I was thinking in French whilst speaking. Of course I still translate in my head from time to time, but there are certain expressions and locutions that I have acquired subconsciously. 
            <br> <br>
            I decided to continue studying French upon entering university, and this is when my French advanced to a whole new level, because this was the first time I was immersed into a fully French-speaking environment - my professors had taught me solely in French! Priorly, English was used in developing my competencies in French. This was a major shift in my French language acquisition journey.
            <br> <br>
            I’m currently finished my first year of university, and I feel that I struggle with the language even more now, because I feel less confident in my abilities in the language. The whole game plan of the language changes because there is no longer a simplified rule, and rather a whole bucket full of exceptions in the language instead. 
            <br> <br>
            My pronunciation has also changed because I am surrounded by Anglophone speakers studying the language, and sometimes I have to adapt my speech to theirs to be understood. An example of this is that I use a lot more English now, because sometimes what I say in French is not understood. I learned a lot of Parisian slang when speaking to French natives during the pandemic, and this is not well-known terminology to Canadian, French-language learners.
            <br> <br>
            I’ve had a very love-hate relationship with this language because sometimes when I’m not understanding a concept I feel unconfident in my abilities in the language. Other times, I regain that love for the language, recognizing its beauty, and I feel more motivated to study it. 
            <br> <br>
            Overall, my journey with French has been long, and frankly, all over the place. I do enjoy being able to speak the language, and I have used this asset in many areas of my life. I am not regretful in choosing this as one of the languages to gain fluency in, and I’m excited to see where else I may go with my knowledge in the French language.
